# Things
This is a collections of various data structures, algorithms and utilities implemented in c++. A lot of the data structures are meant to complement the lessons in MIT Open Courseware's [Introduction to algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) course.
This includes unit testing using [CatchCpp](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
